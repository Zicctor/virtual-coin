## 🎉 DuckyTrading Update Available!

Hey! I've added an **auto-updater** to DuckyTrading so you don't have to manually download updates anymore.

### If you installed with `git clone` (recommended):

**One-time setup to enable auto-updates:**

1. Download this file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zicctor/virtual-coin/master/pyqt_crypto_app/bootstrap_updater.py
2. Save it to your DuckyTrading folder
3. Double-click it or run: `python bootstrap_updater.py`

**Future updates will be super easy:**
- Just double-click `update.bat` 
- That's it! No more downloading.

### If you downloaded a ZIP file:

You have two options:

**Option A - Switch to auto-updates (recommended):**
Follow the guide here: https://github.com/Zicctor/virtual-coin/blob/master/pyqt_crypto_app/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md

**Option B - Keep manual updates:**
- Download new versions from: https://github.com/Zicctor/virtual-coin/releases
- Extract and copy your `.env` and `credentials/` folder over

### What's New in This Update:
- ✨ Styled notification dialogs (looks much better!)
- 🔄 Auto-updater (update.bat and update.py)
- 📚 Better documentation
